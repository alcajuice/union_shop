**PROMPT 1**

In the same row as the logo (https://shop.upsu.net/cdn/shop/files/upsu_300x300.png?v=1614735854), add a button with the text "about". This button will bring us to the about page, but do not worry about implementing that yet. the about button should be white and the text should be grey. Additionally, add a home button with the text "home" with the same style. This row should be visible on all pages of the document going forward. When you are on the home page, the "home" text should be underlined, and the same thing should happen for the about button
